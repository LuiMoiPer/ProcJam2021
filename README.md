# Proc Jam 2021 Entry
The goal is to take in a musical arrangement and play or miss notes depending on runtime conditions.
This is being made as a proof of concept to see if it can be done at runtime and if so whether the results sound good.
Ideally, users will be able to upload MIDI files to test the software with a large range of inputs.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Jaman, Sparrowsion, KilledByAPixel, and everyone else on the [ProcJam discord channel](https://discord.gg/AG9JQEwUNE) for helping me get started with this project.\

A huge thanks to [Cagpie](https://github.com/cagpie) for making the [PicoAudio](https://github.com/cagpie/PicoAudio.js) library that handles playing the audio, I definitely would still be trying to make the correct oscillators if it was not for their work.
If you want to try out the software with some other MIDI files, check out [PicoTune](http://picotune.me/) which is also developed by [Cagpie](https://github.com/cagpie).
