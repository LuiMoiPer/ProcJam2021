# Proc Jam 2021 Entry
The goal is to take in a musical arrangement and play or miss notes depending on runtime conditions.
This is being made as a proof of concept to see if it can be done at runtime and if so whether the results sound good.
Ideally, users will be able to upload MIDI files to test the software with a large range of inputs.
